## Quickstart
For the bare-bones, do-it-yourself experience, all you need is:
```typ
// Get polylux from the official package repository
#import "@preview/polylux:0.2.0": *

// Make the paper dimensions fit for a presentation and the text larger
#set page(paper: "presentation-16-9")
#set text(size: 25pt)

// Use #polylux-slide to create a slide and style it using your favourite Typst functions
#polylux-slide[
  #align(horizon + center)[
    = Very minimalist slides

]

#polylux-slide[
  == First slide

  Some static text on this slide.
]

#polylux-slide[
  == This slide changes!

  You can always see this.
  // Make use of features like #uncover, #only, and others to create dynamic content
  #uncover(2)[But this appears later!]
]
```
This code produces these PDF pages:
![minimal example](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/minimal.png)

From there, you can either start creatively adapting the looks to your likings
or you can use one of the provided themes.
The simplest one of them is called `simple` (what a coincidence!).
It is still very unintrusive but gives you some sensible defaults:
```typ
#import "@preview/polylux:0.2.0": *

#import themes.simple: *

#set text(font: "Inria Sans")

#show: simple-theme.with(
  footer: [Simple slides],
)

#title-slide[
  = Keep it simple!
  #v(2em)

  Alpha #footnote[Uni Augsburg] #h(1em)
  Bravo #footnote[Uni Bayreuth] #h(1em)
  Charlie #footnote[Uni Chemnitz] #h(1em)

#slide[
  == First slide

  #lorem(20)
]

#focus-slide[
  _Focus!_

  This is very important.
]

#centered-slide[
  = Let's start a new section!
]

#slide[
  == Dynamic slide
  Did you know that...

  #uncover(2)[
    ...you can see the current section at the top of the slide?
  ]
]
```
This time, we obtain these PDF pages:

As you can see, a theme can introduce its own types of slides (here: `title-slide`,
`slide`, `focus-slide`, `centered-slide`) to let you quickly switch between
different layouts.
The book
[has more infos](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/themes/themes.html)
on how to use (and create your own) themes.


For dynamic content, polylux also provides [a convenient API for complex
overlays](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book/dynamic/dynamic.html).

Visit the
[book](https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/polylux/book)
for more details or take a look at the
[demo PDF](https://github.com/andreasKroepelin/polylux/releases/latest/download/demo.pdf)
where you can see the features of this template in action.

**âš  This package is under active development.
While I try to make sure that the `main`-branch always is in a usable state,
there are no compatibility guarantees!**

## Testing

This package comes with some unit tests under the `tests` directory.
To run all tests you can run the `just test` target.

You need to have ImageMagick installed on your system, which is needed for image comparison.

### Windows
If you are using the [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package manager, you can install imagemagick using `choco install imagemagick`.
Otherwise download and install a matching package from the [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php) website.
