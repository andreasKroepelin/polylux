#new-section([Introduction])

#slide(title: [About this presentation])[
    This presentation is supposed to briefly showcase what you can do with this
    template.

    For a full documentation, read the
    #link("https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/typst-slides/book/")[online book].
]

#slide(title: [A title])[
    Let's explore what we have here.

    On the top of this slide, you can see the slide title.

    We used the `title` argument of the `#slide` function for that:
    ```typ
    #slide(title: [First slide])[
        ...
    ]
    ```
]

#slide[
    Titles are not mandatory, this slide doesn't have one.

    But did you notice that the current section name is displayed above that
    top line?

    We defined it using
    #raw("#new-section(\"Introduction\")", lang: "typst", block: false).

    This helps our audience with not getting lost after a microsleep.
]

#slide(title: [The bottom of the slide])[
    Now, look down!

    There we have some general info for the audience about what talk they are
    actually attending right now.

    You can also see the slide number there.
]

#new-section([Dynamic content])

#slide(title: [A dynamic slide with `pause`s])[
    Sometimes we don't want to display everything at once.
    #let pc = 1
    #{ pc += 1 } #show: pause(pc)

    That's what the `pause` function is there for!
    Use it as
    ```typ
    #show: pause(n)
    ```
    #{ pc += 1 } #show: pause(pc)

    It makes everything after it appear at the `n`-th subslide.

    #text(.6em)[(Also note that the slide number does not change while we are here.)]
]

#slide(title: [Fine-grained control])[
    When `#pause` does not suffice, you can use more advanced commands to show
    or hide content.

    These are your options:
    - `#uncover`
    - `#only`
    - `#alternatives`
    - `#one-by-one`
    - `#line-by-line`

    Let's explore them in more detail!
]

#let example(body) = block(
    width: 100%,
    inset: .5em,
    fill: aqua.lighten(80%),
    radius: .5em,
    text(size: .8em, body)
)

#slide(title: [`#uncover`: Reserving space])[
    With `#uncover`, content still occupies space, even when it is not displayed.

    For example, #uncover(2)[these words] are only visible on the second "subslide".

    In `()` behind `#uncover`, you specify _when_ to show the content, and in
    `[]` you then say _what_ to show:
    #example[
        ```typ
        #uncover(3)[Only visible on the third "subslide"]
        ```
        #uncover(3)[Only visible on the third "subslide"]
    ]
]

#slide(title: [Complex display rules])[
    So far, we only used single subslide indices to define when to show something.

    We can also use arrays of numbers...
    #example[
        ```typ
        #uncover((1, 3, 4))[Visible on subslides 1, 3, and 4]
        ```
        #uncover((1, 3, 4))[Visible on subslides 1, 3, and 4]
    ]

    ...or a dictionary with `beginning` and/or `until` keys:
    #example[
        ```typ
        #uncover((beginning: 2, until: 4))[Visible on subslides 2, 3, and 4]
        ```
        #uncover((beginning: 2, until: 4))[Visible on subslides 2, 3, and 4]
    ]
]

#slide(title: [Convenient rules as strings])[
    As as short hand option, you can also specify rules as strings in a special
    syntax.

    Comma separated, you can use rules of the form
    #table(
        columns: (auto, auto),
        column-gutter: 1em,
        stroke: none,
        align: (x, y) => (right, left).at(x),
        [`1-3`], [from subslide 1 to 3 (inclusive)],
        [`-4`], [all the time until subslide 4 (inclusive)],
        [`2-`], [from subslide 2 onwards],
        [`3`], [only on subslide 3],
    )
    #example[
        ```typ
        #uncover("-2, 4-6, 8-")[Visible on subslides 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and from 8 onwards]
        ```
        #uncover("-2, 4-6, 8-")[Visible on subslides 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and from 8 onwards]
    ]
]

#slide(title: [`#only`: Reserving no space])[
    Everything that works with `#uncover` also works with `#only`.

    However, content is completely gone when it is not displayed.

    For example, #only(2)[#text(red)[see how]] the rest of this sentence moves.

    Again, you can use complex string rules, if you want.
    #example[
        ```typ
        #only("2-4, 6")[Visible on subslides 2, 3, 4, and 6]
        ```
        #only("2-4, 6")[Visible on subslides 2, 3, 4, and 6]
    ]
]

#slide(title: [`#alternatives`: Substituting content])[
    You might be tempted to try
    #example[
        ```typ
        #only(1)[Ann] #only(2)[Bob] #only(3)[Christopher] likes #only(1)[chocolate] #only(2)[strawberry] #only(3)[vanilla] ice cream.
        ```
        #only(1)[Ann] #only(2)[Bob] #only(3)[Christopher]
        likes
        #only(1)[chocolate] #only(2)[strawberry] #only(3)[vanilla]
        ice cream.
    ]

    But it is hard to see what piece of text actually changes because everything
    moves around.
    Better:
    #example[
        ```typ
        #alternatives[Ann][Bob][Christopher] likes #alternatives[chocolate][strawberry][vanilla] ice cream.
        ```
        #alternatives[Ann][Bob][Christopher] likes #alternatives[chocolate][strawberry][vanilla] ice cream.
    ]
]

#slide(title: [`#one-by-one`: An alternative for `#pause`])[
    `#alternatives` is to `#only` what `#one-by-one` is to `#uncover`.

    `#one-by-one` behaves similar to using `#pause` but you can additionally
    state when uncovering should start.
    #example[
        ```typ
        #one-by-one(start: 2)[one ][by ][one]
        ```
        #one-by-one(start: 2)[one ][by ][one]
    ]

    `start` can also be omitted, then it starts with the first subside:
    #example[
        ```typ
        #one-by-one[one ][by ][one]
        ```
        #one-by-one[one ][by ][one]
    ]
]

#slide(title: [`#line-by-line`: syntactic sugar for `#one-by-one`])[
    Sometimes it is convenient to write the different contents to uncover one
    at a time in subsequent lines.

    This comes in especially handy for bullet lists, enumerations, and term lists.
    #example[
        #grid(
            columns: (1fr, 1fr),
            gutter: 1em,
            ```typ
            #line-by-line(start: 2)[
                - first
                - second
                - third
            ]
            ```,
            line-by-line(start: 2)[
                - first
                - second
                - third
            ]
        )
    ]

    `start` is again optional and defaults to `1`.
]

#slide(title: [Different ways of covering content])[
    When content is covered, it is completely invisible by default.

    However, you can also just display it in light gray by using the
    `mode` argument with the value `"transparent"`:
    #let pc = 1
    #{ pc += 1 } #show: pause(pc, mode: "transparent")

    Covered content is then displayed differently.
    #{ pc += 1 } #show: pause(pc, mode: "transparent")

    Every `uncover`-based function has an optional `mode` argument:
    - `#show: pause(...)`
    - `#uncover(...)[...]`
    - `#one-by-one(...)[...][...]`
    - `#line-by-line(...)[...][...]`
]

#new-section("Themes")

#slide(title: [How a slide looks...])[
    ... is defined by the _theme_ of the presentation.

    This demo uses the default theme.

    Because of it, the title slide and the decoration on each slide (with
    section name, short title, slide number etc.) look the way they do.

    Themes can also provide variants, for example ...
]

#slide(theme-variant: [wake up])[
    ... this one!

    It's very minimalist and helps the audience focus on an important point.
]

#slide(title: [Your own theme?])[
    If you want to create your own design for slides, you can define custom
    themes!

    #link("https://andreaskroepelin.github.io/typst-slides/book/themes.html#create-your-own-theme")[The book]
    explains how to do so.

#new-section([Conclusion])

    Hopefully you now have some kind of idea what you can do with this template.
