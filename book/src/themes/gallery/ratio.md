# Ratio theme

![ratio](ratio.png)

This theme is inspired by the Singapore beamer theme. It has a more modern look, but still features Singapore's navigation sections and sub-section circles.

Use it via

```typ
{{#include ../../IMPORT.typ}}
#import themes.ratio: *

#show: ratio-theme.with(
  aspect-ratio: "16-9",
  title: [Ratio theme],
  abstract: [A theme about navigation and customization],
  authors: (ratio-author("Theme Author", "Typst Community", "foo@bar.quux"),),
  version: "1.0.0",
  date: datetime(year: 2024, month: 4, day: 4),
  keywords: ("foo", "bar"),
  options: (:),
)
```

By default it already generates a cover page and sets some document attributes based on your settings.
You can disable this with `cover: false`.

`ratio` uses polylux' section handling, the regular `#outline()` will not work
properly, use `#polylux-outline` instead.

## Options for initialization

The theme is highly customizable! If there's something you don't like or want to tweak, you probably can.

- `aspect-ratio`: The aspect ratio (16-9 by default).
- `cover`: Wether to include the cover page.

- `slide(title, header, footer)[body]` with a title keyword argument and body positional.
  - `title`: Section title will be added as a heading, too. Mostly for compatibility purposes with other themes.
  - `header`: Header content override. Default is `auto` which draws the header according to the theme options. Set it to `none` to disable for this slide.
  - `footer`: Footer content override. Default is `auto` which draws the footer according to the theme options. Set it to `none` to disable for this slide.
  - `box`: Arguments to the slide's box. Set it to `auto` which draws from theme options, `none` to disable the use of a box or some other arguments to the `box()` function.
  - `align`: Slide content alignment. Set it to `auto` to draw from theme options, `none` to disable further alignment.
  - `body`: Your content such that you can type `#slide[my foo is my bar]`
- `centered-slide(header, footer)[body]` same as `slide` with all content `center + horizon`
- `bare-slide[body]`: For now just an alias of `polylux-slide`

See the [Customization](#customization) feature for ways to change these on the fly!

## Additional features

### Palette

Do you like theme colors? Ratio includes a default palette to pull from in the `ratio-palette` variable. That should make it easier to style things!

### Customization

Ratio's key feature is customization. It stores all it's options in a `ratio-options` state variable. You probably won't interact with that variable directly, but its defaults are included as the `ratio-defaults` variable for you to inspect!

```typ
// Careful, there are a lot of options!
#ratio-defaults
```

You can change the options in one of two ways:

```typ
// Register: replaces the option values given in this dictionary completely.
// For example, this disables the link styling with the little anchor:
#ratio-register((style-links: false))

// Update: recursively updates any dictionaries (i.e. for `text()` related items).
// For example, this only replaces the title text's fill and leaves other options intact.
#ratio-update((title-text: (fill: ratio-palette.danger)))
```

You can put these overrides halfway through your document to change things on the fly!

## Example code

The image at the top is created by the following code:

```typ
{{#include ../../IMPORT.typ}}
{{#include ratio.typ:3:}}
```
