# Rectangles theme

![rectangles](rectangles.png)

This theme is inspired by the LaTeX beamer outer theme "miniframes" and inner theme "rectangles". It is similar to the `university` theme. but designed to be easier to use at the cost of customizability.

Use it via
```typ
{{#include ../../IMPORT.typ}}
#import themes.rectangles: *

#show: rectangles-theme.with(...)
```

`rectangles` uses polylux' section handling, the regular `#outline()` will not work
properly, use `#polylux-outline` instead.
Starting a new section is done via the `#new-section()` function.

Text is configured to have a base font size of 25 pt.

## Options for initialisation
